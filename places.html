                <p>Bikkavolu, located in East Godavari district, Andhra, is home to a number of beautiful temples built during the reign of the Chalukyas. The Vinayaka Temple here is a very famous temple built during the 9th century. The monolithic idol of Lord Ganesha here stands at about 7 feet. Legend has it that a farmer discovered it as a Swayambhu (self-originated idol) while ploughing a field. Hence a temple was constructed in the same place to enshrine the deity. It is said that the idol grows by an inch or so every year. His trunk is turned towards the right and water is seen flowing out from the base of the idolâ€™s left leg.
                    Ganesh Chadurdi is a Hindu festival that is celebrated on the birthday of Lord Ganesha who is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. During this festival, people pray to Lord Ganesha with great devotion and admiration.

                <p>Yanam has natural forests covering 4.9% of its land area, which amounts to 154 hectares. Additionally, there's a small amount of non-natural tree cover, less than 0.1% or 2 hectares.It also stabilizes the coastline, reducing erosion from storm surges, currents, waves, and tides. The intricate root system of the mangrove also makes the forest attractive to fish and other organisms seeking food and shelter from predators. Yanam is located where the Coringa (Atreya) River branches off from the Gauthami into two parts. It's also known for the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, which is near Kakinada, approximately 15 km away on the Kakinada Yanam Road. Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary is a mangrove ecosystem located in Andhra Pradesh, India, near the Godavari River delta. It's known for its rich biodiversity, including various mangrove species, diverse birdlife, and endangered animals like the Smooth-coated Otter and Fishing Cat. The sanctuary is also a breeding ground for the Olive Ridley sea turtle.
                     Mangroves are a group of trees and shrubs that live in the coastal intertidal zone, with a dense tangle of prop roots that make the trees appear to be standing on stilts above the water.  </p>
